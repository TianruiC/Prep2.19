    <h1>Main idea</h1>
    <p>In the book <i>The Truthful Art</i> by Alberto Cairo, the author stated the five qualities to make a great visualization are <u>Truthful</u>, <u>Functional</u>, <u>Beautiful</u>, <u>Insightful</u>, and <u>Enlightening</u></p>
    <p>I chose two data visualizations about the wind map over United states from the internet to compare and analyze what makes the one greater than the another based on Cairo’s five qualities.</p>
    <h2>Great Visualization Example</h2>
<p>This data visualization was screenshot from the website <a href="http://hint.fm/wind/index.html" >Wind Map</a>. Here are the seasons below that why I considered it is a great data visualization based on Cairo’s idea.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Truthful. <br /> As the website itself indicated, the surface wind data comes from the National Digital Forecast Database. It is near-term forecasts, which will be revising once per hour and the data downloaded time was indicated on the upper left corner of the map. </li>
  <li>Functional. <br />The wind speed was indicated by the density of line in the unit area. The benchmark for the wind speed is shown on the left side of the map. This map is actually moving on its original site. This map is actually moving on its original site. By looking at how the lines are changing, we can not only know the wind speed but also the wind direction. This map also has major cities on it and can be zoom in and unzoom to take a closer look in the certain area, which provides the audience to exactly locate the wind speed and direction in their area. </li>
  <li>Beautiful.<br /> The contrast of the grey background color of the map with white moving lines ensures lines that representing the wind can be easily seen by the audience. And the lines are moving in an elegant way, giving the audience a sense of comfort.</li>
  <li>Insightful.<br /> By showing the lines and how the lines are moving, the audience can directly know what’s the wind speed and direction. It’s obvious to let the audience notice where has the fastest wind among the United States and overall direction of the wind.</li>
  <li>Enlightening.<br /> The audience will have a deeper understanding about how the overall wind blowing among the United States by looking at this wind map, which might be hard to gain by just looking the test data about the wind.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This visualization expands the island of knowledge because it’s attracting and people are willing to spend more time looking into this map and easily gain knowledge about wind among the United States.</p>

    <h2>Poor Visualization Example</h2>
    <p>Here are the seasons below that why I considered this one is a poor data visualization compared with the previous one based on Cairo’s idea.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Truthful.<br /> This date visualization does not indicate where the data comes from. </li>
      <li>Functional.<br />It only uses the integer to represent the wind speed in a large area and can’t show the direction of the wind.</li>
      <li>Beautiful.<br />The overall is too complicated with all the lines within the map and the color is too bright to give the audience a comfortable feeling.</li>
      <li>Insightful.<br /> This map does not provide the specific wind speed and direction within a relatively small area that the audience wants to know. They only can estimate the wind speed by the nearest integer number.</li>
      <li>Enlightening.<br />It is not attractive enough to trigger the curiosity of the audience. And the audience can’t learn deeper about the wind among the United States at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This poor data visualization can be improved by creating animated effects to indicates wind speed and direction. The numbers that indicate the wind speed are too much that really annoying the audience from looking at the map. We can make an effect when the mouse was hovering at the specific spot, it will show the precise speed and direction at the location and delete those numbers on the map. And the color to indicates the speed of the wind can be softer to give the audience a comfortable feeling.</p>
