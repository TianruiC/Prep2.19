    <h1>Good Visualization Example</h1>
<p> According to Cairo’s “the five qualities of great visualizations”, a good visualization should be truthful, functional, beautiful,
insightful and enlightening. This example I found online is about 10 language families that that are spoken by at least 1% of world
population. First, this one is truthful, because there is the resource of the data on the uppermost of the graphic- “DataSet referred
to 2013, acquired from ethnologue.com”. Second, it is functional because people can click the buttons below to select the language
they want to see, and the small colorful dots will show on the map. In other words, people can interact with the webpage well. Third,
it is beautiful. The background color makes sure that the text can be easily seen, and the design is very simple and comfortable. Then,
it is insightful to show the data in this way, which directly shows people how the languages distribute in the world. Finally, it is
enlightening since people can easily understand the goal of this graph and the purpose of the author after seeing the graph. Also, they
will have a deeper understanding to this topic.This visualization expands the island of knowledge because it’s interesting to attract
people to learn more from it, and it enables people to get knowledge from it.</p>
